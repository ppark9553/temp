### Naming Conventions in Mined & Keystone:



- Normally in Java, methods follow the "UpperCamelCase()" convention, and variables, also, the "lowerCamelCase" convention;

and in Python, methods follow the "lowercase_separated_by_underscores()" and variables also follow the "lowercase_separated_by_underscores" convention;

however, in Mined and Keystone, we use both cases, so for methods use the "lowercase_separated_by_underscores()", and for variables use "lowerCamelCase". -

      

	*RULES*

1. File (module) name should be one word and lowercased: those that need separation will be done so with '-': file.py, file-with-bar.py,


2. Class names should be upper camel case as follows: "ClassName",


3. Functions or variables only used within a class should begin with '_' (underscore): _functions_within_class(), _variables_within_class,


4. Function names should be written in the following underscore format: function_name(),


5. Variables should be lower camel case as follows: "variableLowerCase", where the first character is lowercase; or as "lowercase_separated_by_underscores" format,


6. Constant variables should be capitalized with underscores: "CONSTANT_VARIABLE".
